                    <p class="par1 _anim-items"><span>The</span> Committee against Torture is a Russian non-profit
                        organization
                        working in the
                        field of human
                        rights protection. Currently, the Committee has the official status of an interregional public
                        organization.
                    </p>
                    <p class="par2 _anim-items"><span>The</span> Committee was founded in 2000 by a number of well-known
                        Nizhny
                        Novgorod human
                        rights
                        defenders as a human rights organization whose task was to exercise public control over the
                        situation related to the problem of the spread of the practice of torture and ill-treatment in
                        Russia and to provide professional legal and medical assistance to victims of torture. The
                        starting point of the activities of the Committee against Torture can be considered the work of
                        the Information and Analytical Center of the Nizhny Novgorod Society for Human Rights, and, in
                        particular, its "Report on the use of torture in the Nizhny Novgorod region", presented in
                        December 1997 by the legal. The report did not achieve the main goal set by the authors — to
                        draw the attention of the prosecutor's office to systematic lawlessness and encourage them to
                        take active actions to prevent and solve this type of crime. This was the reason for the
                        creation in 2000 of an independent organization under the leadership of I. A. Kalyapin — public
                        interest and the principle of focusing on domestic rather than international protection
                        mechanisms.As of March 2019 (since the foundation of the Committee in 2000), the organization
                        has verified more than two thousand received allegations of human rights violations, has
                        achieved the award of more than seventy million rubles in compensation to victims of torture and
                        the conviction of more than one hundred and forty law enforcement officials, has established one
                        hundred and eighty-nine facts of torture, overturned eight hundred and eighty-five illegal
                        decisions and won thirty-six complaints in the European Court of Human Rights
                    </p>
                    <p class="par3 _anim-items"><span>The</span> principle of protecting the public interest is that the
                        organization conducting
                        the
                        investigation does not primarily represent the interests of a particular person - a victim of
                        torture or other gross violation of human rights — but the public interest. The Committee does
                        not undertake any obligation to help the victim if she later wishes to enter into bargaining
                        with the alleged perpetrators or their representatives. Moreover, if in the future the victim
                        changes his testimony in favor of the alleged perpetrators, and by this time the Committee will
                        have convincing evidence of torture, the Committee reserves the right to seek criminal
                        prosecution of both the perpetrators and the victim herself for giving deliberately false
                        testimony and concealing a crime
                        The principle of preferential orientation to domestic protection mechanisms. The main efforts of
                        the public investigation are aimed at making the domestic mechanisms for the protection of human
                        rights work effectively and in accordance with the law. In this scheme, recourse to
                        international mechanisms is considered as a "last resort", which should be used only if all
                        possible ways to achieve justice within the country within a reasonable time are exhausted.
